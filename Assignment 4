Difference between for loop and for-each loop-
Both for loops and for each loops are used in programming to iterate through collections of data, such as arrays, lists, or dictionaries. However, they differ in their syntax and the way they access the data.
For loop
A for loop is a basic loop construct that repeats a block of code a fixed number of times. It uses a loop counter variable to keep track of the number of iterations.

For each loop
A for each loop is used to iterate over the elements of a collection without using an explicit index or loop counter variable. It is also known as a "for-in" or "enhanced for" loop in some programming languages.

The best loop to accessing the array elements is For each loop.
Reason – It is used only for reading elements, which is what most array operations
